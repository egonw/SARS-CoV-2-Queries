# Towards a solution

There is currently no solution for SARS-CoV-2.

But there are ideas about what solutions might be. A vaccin is one of them, but
development of that takes time [<cite>Q87461271</cite>]. But there is also talk about
antibodies and repurposing of drugs. All this is very much exploratory at this
moment. Clinical trials are important (see the [Clinical trials](https://egonw.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-Queries/covid.html#clinical-trials) section).

This Chapter shows a number of queries with information in Wikidata about
leads that people have proposed that may lead to a solution.

## Antibodies

Antibodies are getting an interest. The following query lists articles about
the human coronaviruses and also annotated with the term '<topic>antibody</topic>':

<sparql>antibodies</sparql>

It must be stressed that antibodies are specific for every protein and every
coronavirus has different proteins, and this list is just to shortlist relevant
literature for reading, not to draw conclusions from:

<out>antibodies</out>

## Drug repurposing
