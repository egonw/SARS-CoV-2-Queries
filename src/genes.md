# Genomes, Genes, and Proteins

This chapter gives an over of the genes and proteins of the other SARS-related
and other human coronaviruses.

## All SARSr genes

All genes we get with:

<sparql>virusGenesSARSr</sparql>

Which returns:

<out>virusGenesSARSr</out>

### All SARSr proteins

And all proteins we get with:

<sparql>virusProteinsSARSr</sparql>

Which returns:

<out>virusProteinsSARSr</out>

## All human coronaviruses

Much like that above query, we can also ask for all genes and proteins.
This is done with the following queries.

## All HCoV genes

All genes we get with:

<sparql>virusGenesAll</sparql>

Which returns:

<out>virusGenesAll</out>

### All HCoV proteins

And all proteins we get with:

<sparql>virusProteinsAll</sparql>

Which returns:

<out>virusProteinsAll</out>
