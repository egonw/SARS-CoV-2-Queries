## Genomes

Perhaps the first question should be, which <topic>genomes</topic> have been measured for the SARS-CoV-2 virus:

<sparql>genomes</sparql>

Which lists these genome URLs:

<out>genomes</out>

### Variants

Three variants of the virus genome made it into the international news: a Danish variant, a South-African variant,
and a South-England variant. It must be noted that many variations are known and the following variants are listed
because they have been discussed in newspapers:

<out>sarscov2Variants</out>

These were found in Wikidata with this query:

<sparql>sarscov2Variants</sparql>

These variants are all SARS-CoV-2, but a common type of combinations or sequence variants found in them
gives them different properties. For examples, VUIâ€“202012/01 (also known as B.1.1.7) has a combination
of 17 sequence variants, see [this write up](https://virological.org/t/preliminary-genomic-characterisation-of-an-emergent-sars-cov-2-lineage-in-the-uk-defined-by-a-novel-set-of-spike-mutations/563).
It must be noted that many of these 17 sequence variants are found in other SARS-CoV-2 variants too.

We can list all sequence variants listed in Wikidata (out of a few thousand!) with this query:

<sparql>sequenceVariants</sparql>

This gives us this list:

<out>sequenceVariants</out>

Each sequence variant is a change in the genes encoded by the viral DNA and cause a change in the protein encoded
by that gene. The following two sections lists all genes and proteins.

## Genes

The <topic>RNA</topic> of SARS-CoV-2 has been sequenced. Therefore, the <topic>open reading frames</topic> are known and identified.
We can query for the <topic>gene</topic> information in Wikidata with thie query:

<sparql>virusGenes</sparql>

Which gives us these genes:

<out>virusGenes</out>

## Proteins

Alternatively, we may be interested in the <topic>proteins</topic> of the coronaviruses.
We can get those with this query:

<sparql>virusProteins</sparql>

Which gives us these proteins:

<out>virusProteins</out>

## Protein complexes

Thanks to work done by a team at the online
[BioHackathon in April 2020](https://github.com/virtual-biohackathons/covid-19-bh20),
macromolecular structures from the [Complex Portal](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal/) [<cite>Q57793775</cite>]
have been entering Wikidata:

<sparql>complexes</sparql>

Listing these complexes:

<out>complexes</out>

### PDB structures

For the proteins, we can then query for the <topic>PDB structures</topic> [<cite>Q30491855</cite>]:

<sparql>virusProteinsPDB</sparql>

Which gives us:

<out>virusProteinsPDB</out>
